# Project Ideas

## Learning Game

My kiddo is 5, so I’ve been really interested in technologies that help young children learn. There are about as many learning apps as there are stars in the galaxy, so I realize that it’s tough to do something completely original. Nevertheless, I think it could be really fun to write a game that helps kids learn the alphabet.

## Interactive Visualization of Voter Turnout Data

Another idea has to do with visualizing election results. There’s a program called the United States Elections Project that gathers data about voter turnout in federal elections. It’s incredibly valuable data, but not many visualizations of that data are available. I know that this is something that someone who’s a wizard with Tableau could do in a few hours, but it would be really fun to create some interactive visualizations using something like D3.js.

## Free Website for a Worthy Cause

Another idea would be to just create a site for a worthy nonprofit organization. As you know, I'm a fan of the United States Elections Project. Their site is pretty simple, and it might be nice to give them something that more befits their important work.
