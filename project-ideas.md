# Project Ideas

## Learning Game

My kiddo is 5, so I’ve been really interested in technologies that help young children learn. There are about as many learning apps as there are stars in the galaxy, so I realize that it’s tough to do something completely original. Nevertheless, I think it could be really fun to write a game that helps kids learn the alphabet.

## Interactive Visualization of Voter Turnout Data

Another idea has to do with visualizing election results. There’s a program called the United States Elections Project that gathers data about voter turnout in federal elections. It’s incredibly valuable data, but not many visualizations of that data are available. I know that this is something that someone who’s a wizard with Tableau could do in a few hours, but it would be really fun to create some interactive visualizations using something like D3.js.

## Free Website for a Worthy Cause

Another idea would be to just create a site for a worthy nonprofit organization. As you know, I'm a fan of the United States Elections Project. Their site is pretty simple, and it might be nice to give them something that more befits their important work.



## (Vineet) Build Frontend using REACT.JS 
If our focus is to implement/learn react.js then We can build UI for the eventbrite using platform API's

## Pantry Tracker/Meal Planner

I always wanted to make an app where someone could enter the contents of their fridge, freezer, pantry, etc. as well as update it whenever items are removed or added. The main feature I'd like to have is to have a shelf-life timer on each item so that users can see food items that they may have forgotten about and/or should use. The thing with this is I haven't found any good APIs to get data regarding shelf life of foods, so we would have to make our own API and scraper that pulls data from a website on its own. If we wanted to add more features, we could extend it to being able to allow users to do things like storing recipes, showing missing items for a recipe depending on what's in the inventory, creating a weekly meal plan using these recipes and then generating a grocery list based off of it, and probably more. 

## Jukebox Room (Mainly for tabletop gaming online)

A popular virtual tabletop site, https://roll20.net, recently lost a feature where users could upload music without a limit to play during their table top games (e.g., Dungeons & Dragons). The feature on roll20 allows the person running the games to control multiple tracks of audio at the same time to combine music, sound effects, ambience, etc. I haven't thought too much about how to implement this idea yet, but my initial thought was using websockets to allow users to create rooms that allow a leader to manage multiple Youtube players that the other users hear synchronously using the Youtube API, to mimic roll20's jukebox feature.
